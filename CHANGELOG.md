# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Guiding principles

- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- The latest version comes first.
- The release date of each version is displayed.

## Types of changes

- `🚀Added` for new features.
- `🌟Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- `🗑️Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
- `🧹Removed` for now removed features.
- `🔧Fixed` for any bug fixes.
- `🔒Security` in case of vulnerabilities.

## Semantic versioning structure

The naming strategie recommandation for the semver structure is `version-prerelease` (_for example, `2.3.12-rc`_)

- `version` is the semver-like structure `<major>.<minor?>.<patch?>`
- `prerelease` is the pre-release part of the version `-<prerelease?>`, can be `alpha`, `beta` or `rc`

The meaning of these terms is defined as follows:

- `alpha` means feature incomplete.
- `beta` means feature complete.
- `rc` means this is the code that will be released unless there is a last minute bug found.

## [Unreleased]

- void.

### 🚀Added

- Initial commit.
